 # City Breaks Holiday Program
 
_The program is designed so that the user can choose a city destination
and the program will calculate the total cost for the city break holiday._


**What the program can do**

The Program is written in the Python and makes use of functions. 

The following functions have been set up:


hotel_cost()

plane_cost()

car_rental()

total_holiday_cost()




The functions are used to calculate the user's total holiday cost (total_holiday_cost()),

using user input for:

city choice (plane_cost()),

number of nights stay in a hotel (hotel_cost())

and the number of car rental days (car_rental()).

**Contributors**

This program was carried out by myself as part of the Sofware Engineering Bootcamp task.  During the Bootcamp, the mentors provided tutorials
that taught me Python, about Functions and ensuring best practices.
I am thankful to all of the mentors for their guidance, knowledge, time and expertise throughout the bootcamp.
